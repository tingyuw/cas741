# Documentation

This directory contains subdirectories for Truss's documentation. The templates for all of the documents were from a gitlab repository [cas741](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/cas741).

## Drasil
This directory contains documents generated by [Drasil](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil).

## ProblemStatement
This directory contains a general abstract overview of the problem that Truss solves.

## SRS
This directory contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which explains the purpose of Truss in abstract terms. The SRS provides the theory, symbols, units, formulas, and data formats necessary to answer the problem statement. The requirements (functional and non-functional) given in this document are intended to be addressed later on in the VnV plan.

## VnVPlan
This directory is for the Verification & Validation (VnV) Plan, and it contains system testing and unit testing. System testing is a black box testing, it addresses the system as a whole and follows the SRS. We test the outputs and ensure that the correct inputs are being given such that the requirements can be satisfied. Unit testing is a white box testing. We use test cases to test the system and catch errors in advance to prevent implementation failing.

## VnVReport
This directory is used to document progress that has been made in ensuring Truss's requirements are being satisfied.
